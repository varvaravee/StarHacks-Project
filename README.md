# BridgeSearch Discord Bot

Hello!

Our discord bot, developed during StarHacks II builds a bridge between the user and their community by either connecting them to volunteer resources and opportunities, LGBTQAI+ health resources and cultural events happening near them.

We hope that this discord bot helps gamers connect more to their community and those around them.
